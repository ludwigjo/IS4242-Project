CNA,4,Research Program Director (Data Science),"Arlington, VA",99000 - 159000,"The Data Science Division (DSD) is part of the Center for Naval Analyses. The mission of the DSD is to develop innovative, cutting-edge analytics that are relevant, impactful, and actionable. The DSD provides data science expertise and support to the Department of the Navy and Department of Defense. The division collaborates with our sponsors to transform their operations by making data and analytics an integral part of their decision-making. As part of the Navy?€?s only dedicated FFRDC, we use our analytic skills and our knowledge of naval operations to help create a competitive advantage for the Navy. That advantage has never been more critical than it is today, with great power competition challenging the Navy in several concurrent theaters and across all warfighting domains. The division has full time and part time analysts with advanced degrees in data science, operations research, statistics, economics, computer science, physics, mathematics, engineering, chemistry, and other technical disciplines. The Data Science Division has a large set of core technical competencies, including: Developing supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, such as artificial neural networks, random forests, and clustering, to predict outcomes and assist decision-makers Leveraging high performance computing to obtain insights from big data Developing custom analytical simulations using techniques such as continuous time, discrete event, and Monte Carlo approaches to approximate existing systems to quantify the effects of changes to improve those systems Building and deploying dashboards and dynamic decision support tools in the Navy?€?s cloud environments Identifying optimal solutions using mathematical programming techniques such as mixed integer programming, network analysis, and linear/non-linear programming. Leading and facilitating human centered design workshops to ensure data-driven solutions meet stakeholder requirements and preferences The DSD develops models and analytics to support Navy problems across all Navy domains, including aviation, surface warfare, undersea warfare, cyber, logistics, readiness, force generation, sustainment, acquisition, and cost modeling. DSD analysts support decision-makers by identifying key drivers of both successful and poor performance to improve Navy and Marine Corps outcomes. The division currently supports the Navy?€?s Performance-to-Plan forum, which provides senior Navy leadership forward looking performance forecasts, which are foundational to articulating Navy progress toward readiness and capability goals. Projects generally involve large datasets and complex questions that demand advanced coding skills as well as statistical and modelling techniques. The division leverages agile project management techniques to support faster cycle times to insights and to develop analytic minimum viable products.

Purpose and Scope:

Data Science is accountable for the management and handling of the entire flow of clinical / patient data collected during clinical trials to provide the right data at the right time to all stakeholders involved for data review, monitoring, and decision making. Data Science is also accountable for statistical design and analysis of clinical trials, as well as preparation of data for submissions, integrated analyses, evidence generation, and submission defense. As such Data Science uses an eco-system of clinical data systems, analytical tools, and needs to ingest data from various electronic sources.

This position is accountable to define the strategy for the electronic clinical data flow using the available systems, and to provide a modern Statistical Computing Environment to all end users using closed and open-source software. In addition, the position provides excellence in creating automated / reusable solutions (eg macros) within the available systems to drive efficiency for end users.
