 Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.
 Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.
 Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.
 Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

 Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.
 Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.
 Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.

 Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.
 Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.
 Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.
 Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

Project: AI based condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of Wind turbine assets using acoustics signatures from IoT sensors.
This is an internship project to build an AI based condition monitoring capability for predictive maintenance of Wind turbine blades (and potentially other components) using acoustic signals from IoT. This is a part of a larger PoC project that is in the initial phase of designing and developing an end-to-end IoT architecture including design of an appropriate sensor, IoT device and communication setup, and building a functional AI model for condition monitoring and fault detection. The specific objective of this internship is to build a AI model using deep neural networks and VAEs from real time sensor data to detect anomalous signals from IoT sensors. The solution will need be deployed in Azure cloud environment with end-user notification and dashboarding features, and integrated into existing Predictive Asset Management system. The intern may be tasked with activities within existing renewables projects as a part of overall learning. The intern will also have an excellent opportunity to participate in discussions involving end to end IoT sensor setup and solutioning.
Requirements:
Desired skills: Strong Python and SQL skills. Familiarity with Grafana platform preferred. Good understanding of Data science, Machine learning and deep learning techniques required. Some experience with Azure cloud preferred.
Only fully vaccinated candidates will be shortlisted.Show more Report",https://www.glassdoor.sg/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=108&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=000001877627767d91352d92baf8a627&src=GD_JOB_AD&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_d6a53ccf&cb=1681314510683&jobListingId=1008541225915&jrtk=3-0-1gtr2etltjc8m801-1gtr2etmkgspj800-a4d405641f5e6def-

Project: AI based condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of Wind turbine assets using acoustics signatures from IoT sensors.
This is an internship project to build an AI based condition monitoring capability for predictive maintenance of Wind turbine blades (and potentially other components) using acoustic signals from IoT. This is a part of a larger PoC project that is in the initial phase of designing and developing an end-to-end IoT architecture including design of an appropriate sensor, IoT device and communication setup, and building a functional AI model for condition monitoring and fault detection. The specific objective of this internship is to build a AI model using deep neural networks and VAEs from real time sensor data to detect anomalous signals from IoT sensors. The solution will need be deployed in Azure cloud environment with end-user notification and dashboarding features, and integrated into existing Predictive Asset Management system. The intern may be tasked with activities within existing renewables projects as a part of overall learning. The intern will also have an excellent opportunity to participate in discussions involving end to end IoT sensor setup and solutioning.
Requirements:
Desired skills: Strong Python and SQL skills. Familiarity with Grafana platform preferred. Good understanding of Data science, Machine learning and deep learning techniques required. Some experience with Azure cloud preferred.

 Start Small and Move Fast - We build things fast. If it works, we quickly move on to the question of how we can scale it further. If it doesn’t work, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.

 Start Small and Move Fast - We build things fast. If it works, we quickly move on to the question of how we can scale it further. If it doesn’t work, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.
