Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Assistant (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,35000 - 50000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University. The Research Assistant will support the research project under supervision of PI and Research Fellow in the areas of collecting clean data, compute descriptive statistics of the data, review literature and be involved in manuscript writing.
Candidates should have a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

GVT Government Technology Agency (GovTech),4.0,"Data Engineer (DART), Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Division",Singapore,NA,"Outcome Driven – Our projects are not academic exercises. We are driven by the “so what”, and seek to ensure that our findings and models can translate into tangible impact.
 Start Small and Move Fast - We build things fast. If it works, we quickly move on to the question of how we can scale it further. If it doesn’t work, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Assistant (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,35000 - 50000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University. The Research Assistant will support the research project under supervision of PI and Research Fellow in the areas of collecting clean data, compute descriptive statistics of the data, review literature and be involved in manuscript writing.
Candidates should have a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

We are driven by the “so what”, and seek to ensure that our findings and models can translate into tangible impact.
 Start Small and Move Fast - We build things fast. If it works, we quickly move on to the question of how we can scale it further. If it doesn’t work, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Assistant (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,35000 - 50000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University. The Research Assistant will support the research project under supervision of PI and Research Fellow in the areas of collecting clean data, compute descriptive statistics of the data, review literature and be involved in manuscript writing.
Candidates should have a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

GVT Government Technology Agency (GovTech),4.0,"Data Engineer (DART), Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Division",Singapore,NA,"Outcome Driven – Our projects are not academic exercises. We are driven by the “so what”, and seek to ensure that our findings and models can translate into tangible impact.
 Start Small and Move Fast - We build things fast. If it works, we quickly move on to the question of how we can scale it further. If it doesn’t work, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.
 In this Together - We draw from the deep domain knowledge of our partners and apply best practices from our community of experts.

In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University. The Research Assistant will support the research project under supervision of PI and Research Fellow in the areas of collecting clean data, compute descriptive statistics of the data, review literature and be involved in manuscript writing.
Candidates should have a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.
 In this Together - We draw from the deep domain knowledge of our partners and apply best practices from our community of experts.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Assistant (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,35000 - 50000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University. The Research Assistant will support the research project under supervision of PI and Research Fellow in the areas of collecting clean data, compute descriptive statistics of the data, review literature and be involved in manuscript writing.
Candidates should have a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

We are driven by the “so what”, and seek to ensure that our findings and models can translate into tangible impact.
 Start Small and Move Fast - We build things fast. If it works, we quickly move on to the question of how we can scale it further. If it doesn’t work, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred.

GVT Government Technology Agency (GovTech),4.0,"Data Engineer (DART), Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Division",Singapore,NA,"Outcome Driven – Our projects are not academic exercises. We are driven by the “so what”, and seek to ensure that our findings and models can translate into tangible impact.
 Start Small and Move Fast - We build things fast. If it works, we quickly move on to the question of how we can scale it further. If it doesn’t work, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.
 In this Together - We draw from the deep domain knowledge of our partners and apply best practices from our community of experts.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Assistant (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,35000 - 50000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University. The Research Assistant will support the research project under supervision of PI and Research Fellow in the areas of collecting clean data, compute descriptive statistics of the data, review literature and be involved in manuscript writing.
Candidates should have a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University. The Research Assistant will support the research project under supervision of PI and Research Fellow in the areas of collecting clean data, compute descriptive statistics of the data, review literature and be involved in manuscript writing.
Candidates should have a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

GVT Government Technology Agency (GovTech),4.0,"Data Engineer (DART), Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Division",Singapore,NA,"Outcome Driven – Our projects are not academic exercises. We are driven by the “so what”, and seek to ensure that our findings and models can translate into tangible impact.
 Start Small and Move Fast - We build things fast. If it works, we quickly move on to the question of how we can scale it further. If it doesn’t work, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Assistant (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,35000 - 50000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University. The Research Assistant will support the research project under supervision of PI and Research Fellow in the areas of collecting clean data, compute descriptive statistics of the data, review literature and be involved in manuscript writing.
Candidates should have a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

GVT Government Technology Agency (GovTech),4.0,"Data Engineer (DART), Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Division",Singapore,NA,"Outcome Driven – Our projects are not academic exercises. We are driven by the “so what”, and seek to ensure that our findings and models can translate into tangible impact.
 Start Small and Move Fast - We build things fast. If it works, we quickly move on to the question of how we can scale it further. If it doesn’t work, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.
 In this Together - We draw from the deep domain knowledge of our partners and apply best practices from our community of experts.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Assistant (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,35000 - 50000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University. The Research Assistant will support the research project under supervision of PI and Research Fellow in the areas of collecting clean data, compute descriptive statistics of the data, review literature and be involved in manuscript writing.
Candidates should have a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

GVT Government Technology Agency (GovTech),4.0,"Data Engineer (DART), Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Division",Singapore,NA,"Outcome Driven – Our projects are not academic exercises. We are driven by the “so what”, and seek to ensure that our findings and models can translate into tangible impact.
 Start Small and Move Fast - We build things fast. If it works, we quickly move on to the question of how we can scale it further. If it doesn’t work, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Assistant (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,35000 - 50000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University. The Research Assistant will support the research project under supervision of PI and Research Fellow in the areas of collecting clean data, compute descriptive statistics of the data, review literature and be involved in manuscript writing.
Candidates should have a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Assistant (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,35000 - 50000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University. The Research Assistant will support the research project under supervision of PI and Research Fellow in the areas of collecting clean data, compute descriptive statistics of the data, review literature and be involved in manuscript writing.
Candidates should have a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Assistant (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,35000 - 50000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University. The Research Assistant will support the research project under supervision of PI and Research Fellow in the areas of collecting clean data, compute descriptive statistics of the data, review literature and be involved in manuscript writing.
Candidates should have a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

GVT Government Technology Agency (GovTech),4.0,"Data Engineer (DART), Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Division",Singapore,NA,"Outcome Driven – Our projects are not academic exercises. We are driven by the “so what”, and seek to ensure that our findings and models can translate into tangible impact.
 Start Small and Move Fast - We build things fast. If it works, we quickly move on to the question of how we can scale it further. If it doesn’t work, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.
 In this Together - We draw from the deep domain knowledge of our partners and apply best practices from our community of experts.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

GVT Government Technology Agency (GovTech),4.0,"Data Engineer (DART), Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Division",Singapore,NA,"Outcome Driven – Our projects are not academic exercises. We are driven by the “so what”, and seek to ensure that our findings and models can translate into tangible impact.
 Start Small and Move Fast - We build things fast. If it works, we quickly move on to the question of how we can scale it further. If it doesn’t work, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.
 In this Together - We draw from the deep domain knowledge of our partners and apply best practices from our community of experts.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Assistant (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,35000 - 50000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University. The Research Assistant will support the research project under supervision of PI and Research Fellow in the areas of collecting clean data, compute descriptive statistics of the data, review literature and be involved in manuscript writing.
Candidates should have a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred.

We are driven by the “so what”, and seek to ensure that our findings and models can translate into tangible impact.
 Start Small and Move Fast - We build things fast. If it works, we quickly move on to the question of how we can scale it further. If it doesn’t work, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

GVT Government Technology Agency (GovTech),4.0,"Data Engineer (DART), Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Division",Singapore,NA,"Outcome Driven – Our projects are not academic exercises. We are driven by the “so what”, and seek to ensure that our findings and models can translate into tangible impact.
 Start Small and Move Fast - We build things fast. If it works, we quickly move on to the question of how we can scale it further. If it doesn’t work, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.

Nanyang Technological University,3.9,"Research Fellow (Data Science), [LKCMedicine]",Novena,54000,"Research project: Connecting within-host viral dynamics with the epidemiology of COVID-19: a multiscale computational infrastructure
In this project, we aim to develop a multiscale modeling framework and computational infrastructure to connect within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission dynamics. The multiscale model will help address key epidemiological and public health questions which could not be answered by classic (single scale) approaches. Specifically, we plan to develop and calibrate the multiscale model for SARS-CoV-2 and assess effect of intervention (e.g., antiviral treatment) on epidemiological dynamics.
This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.
The Research Fellow primarily leads the project under supervision of PI in the areas of collecting clean data, reviewing literatures, lead model development, lead data analyses, leading the manuscript writing and other areas of the project support.
Candidates should have a PhD degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred. Good communication skill and respectful attitude for teamwork. The successful applicant will work as part of a growing and energetic team, focusing on quantitatively understanding biological mechanisms of infection and its impact on both individual and population health.

GVT Government Technology Agency (GovTech),4.0,"Data Engineer (DART), Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Division",Singapore,NA,"Outcome Driven – Our projects are not academic exercises. We are driven by the “so what”, and seek to ensure that our findings and models can translate into tangible impact.
 Start Small and Move Fast - We build things fast. If it works, we quickly move on to the question of how we can scale it further. If it doesn’t work, what went wrong and what can we do better next time?
 Ownership – You’re not just here to write code. Team members help to figure out what we should be building, and how we should build.
 Continuous Learning – Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged, but essential.
