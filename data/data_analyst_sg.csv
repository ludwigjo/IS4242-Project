Costello Medical,3.9,Medical Writer/Analyst,Singapore,5000,"Responsibilities: You will be working on projects that involve the detailed analysis and creative presentation of clinical trial data for a range of clients, including the industry�s most successful pharmaceutical and medical technology companies, patient and public health bodies and charitable organisations. Salary: S$4,500 per month. However we may be able to offer a higher starting salary for more experienced candidates or candidates with postgraduate qualifications. Salary increases are typically awarded annually and again on promotion, which can be achieved in as little as 12 months Benefits: Hybrid working options, generous holiday allowance, flexible working hours, private medical insurance, comprehensive travel insurance, full funding for external training and more
 Role Type: Full-time, permanent Start Date: We are currently recruiting for start dates throughout 2023 Location: Our new recruits will be based in our Singapore office
 Medical Communications: Medical communications provide the scientific bridge between clinical development and commercial functions in pharmaceutical and device companies. Most activities have a strong patient and/or healthcare professional (HCP) focus, and act to educate and inform clinical decision making and patient care, or to gather insights that inform a product�s clinical development. These projects require the ability to work closely with clients and prominent HCPs to deliver high quality writing that is scientifically rigorous, patient focused, and in line with the strategic positioning of the pharmaceutical or medical devices products. Working in medical communications at Costello Medical requires excellent project management skills, constant dedication to customer service and the development of strong relationships with clients, academics, and HCPs in the APAC region and globally.

It is possible to work within our medical communications service offering as an Analyst or Medical Writer, with both roles sharing the same level of responsibility. Medical Writers specialise in the strategic planning and development of publications, which include abstracts, posters, oral presentations and manuscripts targeted at scientific journals and conferences. Analysts work across a variety of medical affairs projects and specialise in services such as advisory boards, and the development and multi-channel communication of educational scientific content for a wide range of audiences. The most relevant job title will be discussed with you during the application process.
 Evidence Development: Evidence-based medicine is the cornerstone of medical decision-making. The work of our Evidence Development team encompasses literature reviews, synthesis and real-world evidence generation.

Our literature review and synthesis projects involve the identification of clinical, economic and real-world evidence to support the value of a pharmaceutical product or medical device. Our work includes rigorous systematic literature reviews that our Statisticians often use to conduct meta-analyses and network meta-analyses, therefore Analysts in this team work together with our Statisticians to provide seamless scientific and technical support to our clients. We also work on more creative and pragmatic evidence reviews to inform clients� strategic decisions with regard to clinical development or market access. You will gain a thorough understanding of how to conduct various kinds of evidence review from searching to interpretation of statistical results and ensuring that the reviews conform to industry guidelines where applicable. You will also be involved in writing up the methods and results of the reviews and statistical analyses into engaging reports, slide sets and often congress/journal publications.

Our real-world evidence projects include the design, execution and subsequent reporting of prospective, retrospective or cross-sectional real-world studies. We develop protocols and statistical analysis plans (in collaboration with our Statisticians, Epidemiologists, clients and external experts), acquire and analyse data, and communicate the methodologies and results in both written and oral formats.

Analysts in our Evidence Development team are passionate about finding, synthesising and generating evidence, they have excellent attention to detail and organisational skills, and a talent for communication.
 Market Access (Q3/Q4 Start Date Only): Market access supports timely patient access to drugs and devices, involving the assessment of clinical efficacy and safety alongside costs to determine the value of a therapy within a specific disease area. Market access activities are targeted at a wide range of stakeholders who are instrumental to the successful funding and uptake of novel therapies, such as government bodies, payers, health technology appraisal (HTA) agencies, HCPs, and patients. Our Market Access team supports a wide range of clients in producing materials to demonstrate both the clinical and economic value of some of the newest, most innovative technologies in development. Our work is multidisciplinary, often beginning with evidence generation in the form of literature reviews, advisory boards with clinicians and payers, or economic modelling, to inform the development of materials that present an evidence-based account of the product�s value in a compelling and accessible manner.
Analysts working across our Market Access services support a diverse range of value and access, HTA and health economics projects. These include developing product value messages and materials (e.g. brochures, slidesets, white papers, etc.), building health economic tools and models, and developing dossiers for submission to HTA agencies. A role in the Market Access division suits those who are passionate about patient access to healthcare, are fast-learners and have a strategic, problem-solving mindset. Exceptional writing skills are also essential, especially the ability to summarise complex data in a clear and creative way with high levels of attention to detail
