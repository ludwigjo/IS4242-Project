Pre-processing data: Once you have collected the data, you will need to clean, filter, and transform it to ensure that it is accurate and useful. This may involve using statistical tools and techniques to identify outliers, missing data, or other issues that could affect the analysis
Analyzing data: Using statistical and machine learning techniques, you will analyze the data to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can inform business decisions. This may involve building predictive models or performing exploratory data analysis to identify correlations and relationships between variables
Data visualization: You will be responsible for creating visualizations that help stakeholders understand the insights you have uncovered. This may involve creating charts, graphs, and other visualizations that communicate complex data in a simple and accessible way
Developing Reports: Create report templates that standardize the presentation of data across different business areas or stakeholders. You will need to develop regular reports that track key performance indicators (KPIs) or other metrics that are important to the business. These reports may be weekly, monthly, or quarterly and may be used to inform strategic decision-making. You may be asked to create ad hoc reports that address specific questions or concerns raised by stakeholders. These reports may require quick turnaround times and may involve analyzing data from multiple sources.
Proposing solutions: Based on your analysis, you will need to propose solutions and strategies that can help the business overcome challenges or take advantage of opportunities. This may involve presenting your findings to stakeholders and working with them to develop action plans that can be implemented.
